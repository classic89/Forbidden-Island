# Forbidden-Island

Implementation of the "flooding island" game. 
Allows player to move around the board and collect pieces of a helicopter 
and return to the center of the island before the island floods 

I want to thank aminaly for giving me a place to start because I am lazy and I didn't want to start from scratch when all I wanted to do was practise creating a login page. :)
